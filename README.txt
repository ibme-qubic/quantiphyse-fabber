Fabber plugin for Quantiphyse

To build, use python packaging/build.py. Currently it does not make any 
sense to install using the setup script.

The plugin is in dist/plugin/fabber_qp and can be copied into the Quantiphyse
plugins folder.

A platform-specific package is also created in dist/plugin (e.g. DEB, DMG
or MSI)
